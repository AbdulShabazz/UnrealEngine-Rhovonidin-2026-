- [ ] At the culmination of each coliseum event, the emperor, 
under pressure from the senate (Death to Hebron!) and the crowd (Freedom to Hebron!), 
must vote thumbs up, or thumb down. With each event, the senators force the emperor to drink poison, 
based on the vitriol they ferment for Hebron (e.g., by his avoiding youthful combatants on the field). 
Strategy: Hebron must win flawless strategic victories, while being protected by his fans 
(e.g., by his avoiding/interacting with youthful raving fans on the field)
