- [ ] At the culmination of each coliseum event, the emperor, 
under pressure from the senate (Death to Hebron!) and the crowd (Freedom to Hebron!), 
must vote thumbs up, or thumb down. With each event, the senators force the emperor to drink poison, 
based on the vitriol they ferment for Hebron (e.g., by his avoiding youthful combatants on the field). 
Strategy: Hebron must win flawless strategic victories, while being protected by his fans 
(e.g., by his avoiding/interacting with youthful raving fans on the field)

- [ ] Hebron must successfully block an enemy Ability to gain that ability.

- [ ] Backfill color (BGYOR) of the Combat Carousel communicates player health (when player receives damage, former healthy cells outlines glide to the Left). As time progresses while correct combinations are chosen, HP is regenerated 

- [ ] Hebron can abscond the sewer access keys from a fallen Roman guard and flee through the sewers to his freedom (2 minutes)

- [ ] Ground-directed nuclear blasts are deployed from high altitude sky to destroy grenade tossing air blimps, creating emblazened sky plumes, the ionosphere on fire, and massive blast zones in the coliseum.

- [ ] Massive, wooden, two hundred story pitch forks, having strewn crucified bodies across it are set ablaze and allowed to fall in the coliseum.

- [ ] A Free Roam Open World: The sewers and catacombs are navigable. Perhaps a secret route to the emperor's Imperial Box.

- [ ] multi language (captions) support.

- [ ] The allowed delay between combination cells in the Combat Carousel is 125 ms (1/16th note duration at standard 120 bpm); the allowed delay between maneuvers in each cell is 62.5 ms (1/32th musical note duration), with combinations consisting of one to six maneuvers -- highlighted by the requisite number of hit lamps or strike lamps within each cell.

BPM Metronome [60 to 262]

At DEFAULT 120 BPM
	•	Whole: 2000 ms
	•	Half: 1000 ms
	•	Dotted quarter: 750 ms
	•	Quarter: 500 ms
	•	Quarter-note triplet: ≈ 333 ms
	•	Eighth: 250 ms
	•	Sixteenth: 125 ms
	•	32nd: 62.5 ms
	•	64th: 31.25 ms
	•	128th: 16.125 ms

BPM can be increased to 262 BPM (maneuvers become faster yet less powerful, and require tighter timing between hit lamps); or lowered to 60 BPM (as a result, maneuvers become slower stronger and more deliberate, permitting a more graceful hit lamp timing; however, combination cells and some maneuvers are now easier to block)!

- [ ] Shin guards and forearms guards grant Hebron 100% defense against average foes.

- [ ] The UE Locomotor plugin can be used to auto-rig complex character foot movement through Control
Rig w/ the aid of custom "LookAt" blueprints. The Control Rig Dependency Graph (tab) is actually a debugger which updates CR dependencies frame by frame

- [ ] RepNotify fires an event when a variable changes!

- [ ] Engine/DerivedDataCache, Engine/Saved, Engine/Intermediate, and .vs folders can be safe deleted from Unreal Engine projects to save space.

- [ ] The walls of the coliseum form a squircle, carved into an expansive post volcanic mountain range. Volcanic activity remains in certain areas of the mountain range.
